## What is OpenGPWorkforceData?

<span style="color: #231f20;">OpenGPWorkforceData is a tool to make it easy to understand a practice workforce structure and compare it to other similar or local practices. The intention is to support practices to make informed decisions on their recruitment strategies by being able to benchmark themselves with others.</span>

## Where does the data come from?

<span style="color: #231f20;">Data on the makeup of the GP workforce is collected from every GP practice in England.</span> [NHS Digital provides this data publicly](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/general-and-personal-medical-services/31-march-2021)<span style="color: #231f20;">. I have taken the releases from 2015-2021 and joined them into a</span> [single (massive) file](https://github.com/DrMikeyS/OpenGPWorkforceAnalysis/tree/main/data) <span style="color: #231f20;">that powers this website.</span>

## How does this compare to the NHS Digital Dashboard?

<span style="color: #231f20;">NHS Digital provides a</span> [General Practice Workforce interactive dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTI4NTE1YTUtOTg2Yy00NTc2LTg3OTktZjQ1NzY2NGZlNDRjIiwidCI6IjUwZjYwNzFmLWJiZmUtNDAxYS04ODAzLTY3Mzc0OGU2MjllMiIsImMiOjh9)<span style="color: #231f20;">. While a useful tool, it doesnâ€™t allow easy benchmarking or viewing of historical trends, which are the main aims of this tool. They are both based on the same underlying data.</span>

## Can I ask something or make a suggestion?

<span style="color: #231f20;">Sure! The tool is</span> [open source](https://github.com/DrMikeyS/OpenGPWorkforceAnalysis)<span style="color: #231f20;">. You can fork it and do your own thing, or drop a suggestion in the issues log. You can also reach out on</span> [twitter](https://twitter.com/drmikedsmith)<span style="color: #231f20;">.</span>
