          <h1>What is an IIF point worth for my PCN?</h1>
          <p><em>8 September 2021</em></p>
          <p><strong>The IIF scheme is roaring back to life this October, giving PCNs yet
              more to think about and work on. Despite it&rsquo;s QOF-like nature, the way funding is allocated is
              surprisingly even more complex. This article summarises how the funding works.</strong></p>

          <h3>Point Achievement</h3>
          <p>Starting with the easy bit: points win prizes. Each indicator is allocated a maximal
            number of points that can be gained based on the performance of the PCN in that indicator. For most, there
            is a minimum performance needed before any points are gained and after that, the points are allocated
            proportional to the performance, up to a maximum.</p>

          <p class="ml-5"><em><strong>Example</strong><br>
              For social prescribing (indicator PC-01), the thresholds for points are
              set at
              0.8-1.2% of the PCN
              population having been referred in the full financial year. Therefore, if 0.6% of patients are referred,
              the
              PCN earns 0 points. If 1.6% are referred, the PCN earns all 20 points. If 1.0% are referred, the PCN earns
              10 points.</em></p>

          <h3>Population &amp; Prevalence Adjustment</h3>
          <p>Now it starts getting a bit tricky. What does a point really mean?
            NHS England states a point is worth &pound;200. However, that is not the full story. That &pound;200 is the
            amount per point an average sized PCN will get for an indicator, where they have an average disease
            prevalence for that indicator.</p>

          <p>The rationale is that it would not be fair for a PCN with 100k patients to be paid the same amount in
            absolute terms as a PCN with 30k patients.</p>

          <p>It would also be unfair for two PCNs with the same population to be paid the same for the learning
            disability indicator if one PCN has a very large LD register and the other a very small register, as the PCN
            with the larger register will need to do more work to achieve it .</p>

          <p>Payments for each indicator are calculated by applying the following formula:</p>
          <p class="text-center"><img src="img/formula.png"></p>

          <p>The list size adjustment applies to all indicators. However, several indicators do not need a prevalence
            adjustment, as they apply to the whole PCN population. Both adjustments will be based on the practice
            population data from January 2022.</p>
          <p>The following example helps to explain this:</p>

          <p class="ml-5"><em><strong>Example</strong><br>Fictional PCN has a population of 70,000. For social
              prescribing (PC-01), they have achieved all 20 points
              by referring 1.3% of their patients to a social prescriber in the year. As the indicator applies to all
              patients of any age, the register size is the same as the population size and therefore there is no
              adjustment for prevalence (or adjustment=1). However, the PCN has a population which is 1.45 times the
              national average, which is currently 48,274. Therefore, for the indicator, the PCN will be paid:
              <br>
              20 points
              x
              &pound;200 per point x 1.45 list size adjustment = &pound;5,800</em></p>



          <p>For list size adjustment, the <strong>current PCN average population is: 48,274.</strong></p>

          <h3>Thoughts on Prevalence Adjustments</h3>
          <p>The national averages for prevalence adjustments are much harder to come
            by. Some, such as the number of care home beds per PCN, are not available at all. Others could be estimated
            by looking at QOF data from 2019, but this is likely to be out by some margin given the age of the data.
            Most PCNs will have a broadly similar population mix, and therefore I think it is reasonable to base your
            estimations on there not being a significant prevalence adjustment for any indicator. The exceptions to this
            would be PCNs with atypical populations, such as having a large student population; an unusually old or
            young population; a large number of care home beds; or a large LD register.</p>

          <a href="IIF 2021-22.xlsx">Download Ready Reckoner Spreadsheet</a>

          <p>I have published a &ldquo;ready reckoner&rdquo; that makes it easy to track your performance and estimates
            the value of each indicator to your PCN. It adjusts the value of points using the above methodology to fit
            your PCN population. It assumes that there are no prevalence adjustments, so if you do have one of the
            atypical populations mentioned above, please bear that in mind. </p>
